# Gate-failed base-pool release lane

## State

Containment, opt-in carriage, and preflight surfacing are implemented. Focused
builder, authenticated-H5, and preflight tests pass. The implementation now
rejects both redundant green-pool waivers and any release-manifest receipt that
does not exactly match the pool authenticated by preflight; the preflight's
historically required base/selection inputs and exit semantics are unchanged.

## Done

- Confirmed the assigned branch and worktree.
- Recorded the v2 charter: close the legacy bare-H5 multispine bypass, add an
  explicit release-build opt-in, carry the authenticated red verdict, and
  surface it in publication preflight without making it an automatic
  publication failure.
- Confirmed that no network, artifact builds, publishing, or pushes are in
  scope.
- Traced the strict manifest loader, current stacked-only terminal-failure
  exception, H5 identity stamp, pool sidecar naming, legacy release arm,
  release manifests, and both preflight output modes.
- Reviewed the salvage branch's final source and test diff line by line. Its
  shared classifier/path-binding/receipt approach closes the bypass without
  changing either loader's contract and is suitable to retain with the two
  coherence corrections above.
- Completed the `simulation_ready` / `gate_failed` / loader consumer audit.
  Exact-k remains deliberately strict and head-to-head scoring remains the
  existing authenticated evidence exception.
- Identified report-only downstream caveats: stacked producer metadata still
  names only the k-ladder readiness consumer; red pool publication returns
  status 1 and stops shell chains; ACS-local derivatives keep a donor revision
  but do not project the nested red verdict; generic release consumers tolerate
  and ignore the additive receipt.
- Added a release/preflight-specific authenticated pool loader over the shared
  `require_simulation_ready` seam. The strict simulation-ready and existing
  scoring-only loader contracts remain unchanged.
- Closed the bare-H5 path by detecting either the canonical sibling manifest
  or the H5's stamped pool identity, requiring the sidecar, authenticating the
  publication triple, and binding it to the exact requested H5 path.
- Added `--allow-gate-failed-base-pool` only to the legacy `--base-h5` arm.
  It admits only a current authenticated stacked `gate_failed` pool, rejects a
  green or non-pool use, and never affects the exact-k arm.
- Added the self-contained `base_pool` receipt to both manifests, including
  status/readiness, immutable pool identities, flag use, gates JSON SHA-256,
  failure count/list, and the complete terminal verdict.
- Kept the static preflight inputs mandatory, authenticated its base identically,
  displayed red evidence prominently without changing its exit calculation,
  and required optional release-manifest carriage to match the authenticated
  receipt exactly.
- Hardened carried verdict normalization so nested pass/failure pairs and the
  aggregate verdict must be coherent and a red battery cannot report zero
  failures.
- Passed focused Ruff and the complete builder/H5/preflight test files after
  the containment changes.

## Next

- Run the broader affected exact-k, launcher, and data-contract suites.
- Run Ruff and every pytest shard in its own process, then write `out.md`.

## Historical prior lane

The stacked-pool-to-release CD-vintage provenance lane previously maintained
this journal and completed before this work began. It authenticated and
applied household geography after source assembly, carried that authority
through checkpoint and publication identities, published verified CD-vintage
H5 attributes, and reached the unchanged release guard through the shared
fixed/table-aware reader. Its final verification was 7,241 passed, 77 skipped,
with repository-wide Ruff and anti-rot checks green. Full details remain at
commit `2263df36` (the parent of this lane's first journal commit).

The still-earlier PolicyEngine-US 1.819.0 lock-bump lane merged into
`origin/main` at `7b90bb18` on 2026-08-24; its final state remains at commit
`05d254aa` and its detailed receipts remain in the historical section of
`_LANE-NOTES.md`.
