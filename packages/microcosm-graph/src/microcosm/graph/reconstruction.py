"""Declaration-only graph schemas rebuilt after a build from its recorded files.

A build that recorded its graph declaration but no run binding cannot have its
execution verified, yet its declared graph is still exact. A reconstructed
schema projects that recorded declaration alone and carries a marker in its
producer extensions: the marker says the schema was rebuilt afterwards, names
the code revision that declared the graph, and binds every input file by
digest. Because the marker lives in ``graph.schema.json``, any later
projection of the saved schema keeps it, and Orrery documents show it under
``metadata.microcosm.extensions``. Nothing here presents an operation as
executed; no receipt, cache or gate state is attached.
